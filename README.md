Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and improving patient outcomes. Machine learning techniques provide a promising approach for predicting breast cancer diagnosis based on various clinical and diagnostic features.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [insert source here]. It contains a total of [insert number of instances] instances and [insert number of features] features. Each instance represents a breast cancer biopsy, and the features include measurements of tumor characteristics obtained from diagnostic images.

Approach
Data Preprocessing: The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and standardize feature values.
Model Training: Several machine learning algorithms were trained on the preprocessed dataset, including logistic regression, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, AdaBoost, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and XGBoost.
Model Evaluation: The trained models were evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
